# Sustainable World

## Introduction
Welcome to Sustainable World - an innovative app with a vision to create a greener and more sustainable planet. Our app aims to connect two essential roles: Disposers and Recyclers.

### What is Sustainable World?
Sustainable World is a mobile application that facilitates responsible waste management and recycling. It allows users to play an active role in contributing to a cleaner environment by responsibly disposing of items they no longer need and providing valuable resources for Recyclers.

## Disposers
As a Disposer, you are an essential part of the Sustainable World community. Disposers are individuals who seek responsible ways to manage waste, including organic leftovers, old clothing, leftover food, electronic devices, and more. By listing your items on the app, you can find sustainable solutions for recycling and repurposing.

### How to Post a Product?
1. **Categorize:** Choose the appropriate category for your product, such as clothes, plastic, flowers, metals, etc.
2. **Provide Details:** Fill in essential product information:
   - **Title:** Give your product a clear and descriptive title.
   - **Description:** Provide additional details about the product's condition, size, or any relevant information.
   - **Quantity:** Specify the number of items you are posting.
   - **Images:** Add multiple images to showcase your product.
3. **Tags:** Add relevant tags to help Recyclers find your product easily.
4. **Contribution Type:** Choose between "SELL" or "DONATE" based on your preference.
   - If you choose "SELL," add the amount you want to sell the product for.
5. **Recipient Selection:**
   - **For All Recyclers:** Choose to make the product available for all users of the app.
   - **Selective NGOs:** Select a specific NGO as the recipient if you wish to support a particular cause.
6. **Pick Up Location:** Provide the location where the product can be picked up.

## Recyclers
Recyclers play a vital role in the Sustainable World ecosystem. They are Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and recycling facilities that are passionate about recycling and repurposing materials.
